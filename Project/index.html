            The Game of Life , also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton
            devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is
            a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
            initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game
            of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it
            evolves. It is Turingcomplete and can simulate a universal constructor
            or any other Turing machine.

            The game takes place on an infinite board divided into square cells.
            Cells can be "alive" or "dead"("1" or "0" - white or black). Succesive
            generations are moments of time. There are 2 rules of calculating next
            generation:<br />
            - "dead" cell which has exacly 3 "alived" neighbors, becomes
            "alived".<br />
            - "alived" cell with 2 or 3 "alived" neighbors stays "alived";<br />
            in another case cell dies.
